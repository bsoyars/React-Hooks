## TypeScript: The Best Resources to Learn It

A few months ago, after a long time studying and reviewing every single subject in (Vanilla) JavaScript and React.js, I decided to learn TypeScript. But, one of the most difficulties as a developer is to decide how and where to learn it, since we have a lot of resources in the world and don't know which one is better. So, in this article, I'll show you **6 sources to learn TypeScript** divided by different ways of learning and don't waste time searching.

## Interact

####  [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) 

If you want to interact with the code and learn, I always recommend Codeacademy as a good resource, besides for each lesson a quick summary and tasks.
